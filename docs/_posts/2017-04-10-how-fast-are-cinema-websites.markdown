In [2013 I researched how UK cinemas](https://rae.li/web-analysis-uk-europa-cinemas/) were fairing with their website performance.

Given changes to audience behaviour, technology, skills, and investment in the sector, I thought an update would be interesting.

### Why is speed important?

There’s plenty of research on this, but these are quoted endlessly:

* 40% of users will leave if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load
* Facebook shows that pages that are 0.5 seconds slower result in a 3% drop in traffic
* If Amazon increased page load time by 100 milliseconds they lost 1% of sales
Here are some recent pieces of research on this:

ThinkWithGoogle – [Why marketers should care about mobile page speed](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/mobile-page-speed-load-time.html)
Financial Times – [A Faster FT.com](http://engineroom.ft.com/2016/04/04/a-faster-ft-com/)

### Here’s the data:

We focus on the time to load in this case, as this is the real audience’s perspective – the grading systems from Google/Yslow are really to indicate the potential of pages to improve speed.

With average loading times in 2013 being 4.76s, and 2017 being 3.29s, there is a definitive improvement, but still plenty of work to be done. You can see on the comparison tab that almost all venues have improved to some degree, but still a few have regressed.

### Some interesting points:

* Average website size of 2.63mb (this is 2.23mb without The Dukes Lancaster)
* Average loading time of 3.29 seconds
* A long load time of BFI at 6.2 seconds
* The Dukes Lancaster having an extremely large 19mb home page
* The MVP was Stoke Film Theatre – an incredible load time of 0.2 seconds
* Only Watershed reaching an A grade in either Google or Yslow

### Content Management Systems Used

Definitely interesting to see the CMS used, with WordPress and Drupal leading the way. Many custom CMS were used as well, often deeply integrating with CRM systems.

* Craft	2
* Custom	16
* Drupal	7
* Squarespace	1
* Wordpress	14
