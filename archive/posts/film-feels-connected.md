Film Feels is a UK-wide annual film season, working with independent cinemas, festivals and venues in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to offer audiences access to unique film events and programmes. Supported by the British Film Institute's Film Audience Network.

The COVID 19 pandemic has pushed us apart physically, but cinemas and their audiences are still finding ways to come together, through watch parties, exclusive previews, tweetalongs and VOD//venue partnerships.

Film Feels Connected is a season designed to spotlight innovation across BFI FAN, to promote online activity during lockdown and to help cinemas, festivals and societies access support to try out new activity.

This website builds on the [launch](/posts/film-feels-website) of filmfeels.co.uk last year, adapting [Ostende](/posts/ostende) to use for online screenings, rather than physical locations. Ostende is built with Django in Python, and is open source.

The objective here is to build a powerful and flexible backend, with a clean frontend design that lets the films speak for themselves.
