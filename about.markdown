👋 **Hi I’m Andy Rae,** I work in film helping connect cinemas and audiences.

🎬 I work at [BFI Film Hub Midlands](https://filmhubmidlands.org), based at [Broadway Nottingham](https://www.broadway.org.uk).

🔎 I'm currently making [Film Research](https://filmresearch.org), a library of film research, reports, and data sets from the UK film industry.

📈 I also occasionally [write](/tag/writing) about using data to find things out.

☕️ I like to meet new people. Let me know if you want to grab a coffee.
