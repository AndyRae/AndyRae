👋 **Hi I’m Andy Rae,** - I build things with code, and work in film helping connect cinemas and audiences.

🎬 I work at [BFI Film Hub Midlands](https://filmhubmidlands.org), based at [Broadway Nottingham](https://www.broadway.org.uk).

💥 I'm currently making [a bunch of things](/tags/projects).

📈 I also occasionally [write](/tags/writing) about using data to find things out.

🚀 I'm available to [hire](/hire).

☕️ I like to meet new people, let me know if you want to grab a coffee.
