The design is clean, modern, and easy to build on.</p>\n<p>Built with Django, and using Django Rest Framework, it's also a great example of an efficient Django app in production. It can handle tens of thousands of screenings on a low cost virtual machine.</p>\n<p>Find an example at <a href=\"https://filmfeels.co.uk\">filmfeels.co.uk</a> - used for the <a href=\"/posts/film-feels-website\"><em>Obsession (2019)</em></a> and <em>Connected (2020)</em> seasons.</p>\n<p>The code is open source, and can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/AndyRae/ostende\">Github</a>.</p>\n","title":"Ostende - Django for film seasons","date":"2020-02-23","image":"/assets/images/projects/ostende.png","tag":"projects"}},"__N_SSG":true}
