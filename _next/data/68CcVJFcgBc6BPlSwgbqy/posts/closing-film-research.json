It contributed to many studies, research pieces, and analysis over that time.</p>\n<p>But it did take my time up, for free, a bit like looking after a puppy, which is no longer possible for me. Unfortunately, there is no grant funding for research or intelligence in the film industry.</p>\n<p>An export of all the data and research is available <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wFRQEZI84jQPw4vDQydNEBHvFc2T1wlD?usp=sharing\">here</a>, for a couple of months after this post.</p>\n<p>Instead, I'd point towards the excellent:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://filmresearch.eu\">filmresearch.eu</a>, which I'd hope was inspired by this project;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/industry-data-insights\">bfi.org.uk</a> industry data and insights;</p>\n<p>and <a href=\"https://www.the-bigger-picture.com\">The-Bigger-Picture.com</a> from the Film Audience Network.</p>\n","title":"Closing FilmResearch.org","date":"2021-06-05","image":"/assets/images/projects/fr-3.png","tag":"projects"}},"__N_SSG":true}
