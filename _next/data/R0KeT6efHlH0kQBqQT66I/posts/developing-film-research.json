{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"developing-film-research","contentHtml":"<p>Back in February I <a href=\"/posts/launching-filmresearch-org\">launched</a> a beta of <a href=\"https://filmresearch.org\">FilmResearch.org</a>, a library of film research, reports, and data sets from the UK film industry.</p>\n<p>Since then I've added hundreds more resources, and made some other changes too...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/projects/fr-2.png\" alt=\"website\"></p>\n<p>I've rebuilt the site from the ground up with <a href=\"https://getgrav.org\">Grav</a>. Making it easier to find and discover new and helpful resources.</p>\n<p>Using Grav also means every resource is written in <a href=\"https://www.markdownguide.org/\">Markdown</a>, making it easy to host the entire archive on <a href=\"https://github.com/AndyRae/film-research\">GitHub</a>.\nThis isn't just a backup, but also a way of being very transparent about the content and any edits made. Whilst also providing the infrastructure inviting anyone to <a href=\"https://filmresearch.org/contribute\">contribute</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm aware there's a technical learning curve to Github, Markdown, and Grav... so I've retained the easier way of reporting any edits as well.</p>\n<p>And it's all open source - so anyone can download the repository and create their own.</p>\n","title":"Developing FilmResearch.org","date":"2018-05-09","image":"/assets/images/projects/fr-2.png","tag":"projects"}},"__N_SSG":true}
