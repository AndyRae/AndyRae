Film Feels is a UK-wide annual film season, working with independent cinemas, festivals and venues in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to offer audiences access to unique film events and programmes. Supported by the British Film Institute's Film Audience Network.

Film Feels returns for 2022, once again celebrating filmsâ€™ unique ability to transport us, to illuminate ideas, and to spark a conversation.

This website builds on the [launch](/film-feels-website) of filmfeels.co.uk three years ago, using [Ostende](/ostende) in production.  Ostende is built with Django in Python, and is open source.

The objective was to build a powerful and flexible backend, with a clean frontend design that lets the films speak for themselves.
