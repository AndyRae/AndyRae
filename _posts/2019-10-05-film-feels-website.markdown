Film Feels is a UK-wide annual film season, working with independent cinemas, festivals and venues in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to offer audiences access to unique film events and programmes. Supported by the British Film Institute's Film Audience Network.

With over 250 screenings nationwide, [Film Hub Midlands](https://filmhubmidlands.org) needed a website that can not only provide searchable listings, but also grasp the feel of the season, extending the stunning brand from [Sail Creative](https://sailcreative.co.uk).

The website is built with Django in Python, and uses **Ostende**, a listing service that I'll be releasing as open source in the next few weeks.

>*"Andy created an elegant site for our public programme in a short space of time, and exceeded our original spec and expectations. It's beautifully fit for purpose on the outside and underpinned by impeccable logic to help us grow and target audiences as the project progresses."*

***Annabel Grundy, Film Hub Midlands***
