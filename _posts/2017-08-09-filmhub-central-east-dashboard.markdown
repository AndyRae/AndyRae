At Film Hub Central East we have over 30 projects running at any time.

Our technical architecture consists of large datasets of screenings, venues, demographics, and various funding elements to support this.

The dashboard provides a live way for stakeholders to be up to date on projects at a glance, in a simple and lightweight way.

It is responsive, and based on Googleâ€™s material design.

Design and developed by me.
