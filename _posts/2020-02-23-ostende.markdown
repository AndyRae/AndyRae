Ostende is an open source film screenings system, built with Python on Django.

Ostende has one principle objective - build reusable infrastructure for film exhibition. Websites for seasons are often built with the wrong tools at great cost. Ostende makes it cheap, fast, and easy to deploy a website focussed on reaching people.

Ostende is audience focussed - enabling a user to find and discover film screenings by venue, location, film, and date. With the additional option for articles and editorial to frame a season. The design is clean, modern, and easy to build on.

Built with Django, and using Django Rest Framework, it's also a great example of an efficient Django app in production. It can handle tens of thousands of screenings on a low cost virtual machine.

Find an example at [filmfeels.co.uk](https://filmfeels.co.uk) - used for the [_Obsession (2019)_](/film-feels-website) and _Connected (2020)_ seasons.

The code is open source, and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/AndyRae/ostende).
