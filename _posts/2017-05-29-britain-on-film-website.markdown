A new revision of the Britain on Film screenings website, in preparation for the Coast and Sea season this summer.

*An exciting programme of archive film screening events bringing our coastal heritage to life this summer 2017. With screenings on the beach, the prom, the ferry, and the rocks and some more imaginative backdrops of ship sails and water tanks.*
