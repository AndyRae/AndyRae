After a little over 3 years, a few weeks ago I closed down [filmresearch.org](./launching-film-research.html)

The website managed to preserve hundreds of resources and data sets over those years, and distribute them widely to others. It contributed to many studies, research pieces, and analysis over that time.

But it did take my time up, for free, a bit like looking after a puppy, which is no longer possible for me. Unfortunately, there is no grant funding for research or intelligence in the film industry.

An export of all the data and research is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wFRQEZI84jQPw4vDQydNEBHvFc2T1wlD?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"}, for a couple of months after this post.

Instead, I'd point towards the excellent:

[filmresearch.eu](https://filmresearch.eu){:target="\_blank"}, which I'd hope was inspired by this project;

[bfi.org.uk](https://www.bfi.org.uk/industry-data-insights){:target="\_blank"} industry data and insights;

and [The-Bigger-Picture.com](https://www.the-bigger-picture.com){:target="\_blank"} from the Film Audience Network.
