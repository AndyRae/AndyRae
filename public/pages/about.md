👋 **Hi I’m Andy Rae.**

I work as a Software Engineer at the University Of Nottingham, in the [Digital Research Service](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/dts/researcher/digital-research-service/digital-research-service.aspx).

I previously spent a decade working in the UK film industry, before moving into technology in 2022.
